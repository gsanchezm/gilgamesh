# Feature status — the product board (living)

One-glance status of the whole product: what's shipped, what's functional-but-unskinned, and what's
missing/blocked. **This is the single board** — check a box when something lands. It links to the
authoritative detail rather than repeating it, so it can't drift:

- Per-slice DoD detail → [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) (Slice N status sections)
- Owner decisions → [`decisions-log.md`](decisions-log.md)
- Audit remediation → [`audit-followup.md`](audit-followup.md)
- Pricing/business model → auto-memory `gilgamesh-pricing.md`

**Legend:** ✅ done (backend + UI faithful to the capture) · 🟡 functional but UI not re-skinned to the
capture / partial · 🔵 stub behind a port (runs offline; real engine pending) · 🔴 not built / blocked.

_As of 2026-07-12 (keystone v0.7). Everything below is merged on `main`: slices 1–33 + programa
v2 (Stripe 13 · SSO 15 · Voyage embeddings 16 · SMTP 17 · logout 18) + programa v3 (token billing 14 ·
Voyage BYOK 19 · Key Vault 20 · Redis SSO state · Vitest 3) + programa v4 (billing rollover 21 · voyage
hint 22 · error boundary 23) + v5 (request-id 24 · http resilience 25 · bundle gate 26 · readiness 27 ·
async-states 28) + v6 (graceful shutdown 29 · structured logging 30 · db pool 31 · connection banner 32 ·
adopt async-states 33) + v7 (stripe portal 34 · logging+CORS 35 · db-pool proof 36 · web async-states 37 ·
CI sha-comments 38) + programa v8 (per-IP lockout 39 · Stripe proration/refunds 40) + **v8 lockout tuning**
(A1 ceiling excludes login · `RESET_TOKEN_INVALID` so weak-password fumbles don't feed the lockout) + **responsive pass** (mobile drawer shell + per-screen reflow, all 7 authed screens,
desktop unchanged) + **admin console** (platform + workspace roles, 14 views from captures 15–22, lazy chunk,
i18n es/en, mock behind a service, workspace never sees costs), plus Reports, onboarding wizard, per-org RAG
grounding, CI hardening, plus a **pre-auth responsive** pass (Login/Register/Forgot/Reset on mobile), an
**admin access gate** (the mock admin console is now behind real auth + org checks + a platform flag, no nav
entry, "Demo data" badge), and an **image-asset slim** (~3.95 MB off the build), plus **programa v9**
(keystone v0.7 in series first, then 3 parallel slices: **Stripe partial-refunds 41 · voice STT/TTS 42 ·
Reports per-tool 43**). Gates: **1354 Docker-free** · int 43 · Playwright 20 · pnpm audit 0. **BDD full-sweep =
quiet-machine follow-up** (the local env kills cucumber mid-run; the slices are covered by Docker-free
`billing.e2e`/`voice.e2e`/`runs.e2e` + Playwright + `test:int`; last completed sweep was 215/217, the 2
failures being onboarding-401 flakes under CPU starvation, orthogonal to v9)._

> **🚀 STAGING LIVE + REDEPLOYED (2026-07-12):** the whole app runs LIVE on **Azure Container Apps** —
> `https://app.ashygrass-47d0b048.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io` (app+ACR+KV in eastus2, Postgres in
> centralus due to an offer restriction, full RAG corpus = 2655 chunks). **Redeployed to image `:f6ebf78`**
> (everything on `main` through programa v8 + the lockout tuning now live; revision `app--0000004`
> Healthy/RunningAtMaxScale/100%; liveness+readiness 200; §7 staging smoke 2/2 green). Brain runs the
> deterministic stub until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. Runbook + subscription-restriction workarounds:
> [`../../specs/infra/staging-deploy.md`](../../specs/infra/staging-deploy.md) §8. **`main` is now AHEAD of
> staging** — programa v9 (slices 41/42/43 + keystone v0.7 migration) is merged locally but **NOT yet
> deployed** (staging still runs `:f6ebf78`). A redeploy applies the `run_result_tool_discipline` migration
> (`migrate deploy` runs on boot). Code-only rollout recipe: `docker build --provenance=false
> --sbom=false` → push to ACR → `az containerapp update -n app --image …`.

## 1) Product views (the 14 design captures)

Backend = does the data/logic exist · UI = re-skinned to the `capturas/NN` target.
**To mark progress, bump the status cell** (🔴 → 🟡 → ✅).

Extra flow screen (no dedicated capture):

- [x] Onboarding wizard — ✅ on `main` (`d58ba93`): re-skin + Company→`orgName` (AC-ONB-14; incl. a React Router 7 `startTransition` race fix so the carried company survives the authed-guard redirect). Verified: BDD 115/915 · Playwright onboarding-company e2e.

## 2) Engine / backend capabilities

Real vs. stub-behind-a-port. Swapping a stub for the real adapter is a future slice, not a rewrite.

- [x] Auth · session · CSRF · rate-limit — ✅ real (Argon2id, `__Host-` cookies, double-submit)
- [x] Persistence Prisma/Postgres + pgvector — ✅ real (per-`orgId` tenant isolation on every query)
- [x] Test Lab authoring (Slice/Feature/TestCase, Gherkin parser) — ✅ real
- [x] Integrations (github/gitlab/bitbucket/ado_repos; token never persisted) — ✅ real
- [ ] Test execution + results — 🔵 `DeterministicKernel` stub (real TOM/chaos-proxy kernel pending)
- [x] AI brain (chat · routing · draft generation) — ✅ **real `ClaudeBrain` adapter on `main` (slice 9)** behind `SelectingBrain`: real answers with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or org BYOK — call-time resolution pending `SecretVault.get()`), deterministic stub offline/CI; per-org `BrainUsage` metering + usage view + tool registry + live C3 SSE (`?live=1`)
- [x] RAG embeddings — ✅ **real Voyage `voyage-4` semantic embeddings (slice 16)** behind the frozen `AgentBrainPort.embed` + the `embedAs(texts, kind)` extension: 1024-dim `vector(1024)` column (keystone v0.5 BREAKING; destructive migration + re-ingest), real with `VOYAGE_API_KEY`, deterministic lexical FNV-1a 1024-dim offline/CI; EMBED `BrainUsage` metering. **+ Voyage BYOK (slice 19)**: per-org voyage key via the S6 flow behind the **S19-6 coherence gate** (org key embeds only inside the platform voyage space — platform-keyless stays lexical, retrieval can never silently degrade); per-chunk provenance + re-embed on connect = future slice
- [x] Brain token billing (slice 14) — ✅ real: per-plan AI-token allowances derived from `PLAN_CATALOG` (FREE 100k · STARTER 2M · GROWTH 10M · SCALE unlimited; billable = input+output, cache excluded), pre-check + atomic UoW charge with each `BrainUsage` row on every org-attributed surface, blocked chat NARRATES (never 402/500) / 402 elsewhere, quota meter on the Billing AI-usage card; rollover job (resets both counters) pending
- [x] Payments / checkout — ✅ **real Stripe (slice 13)** behind the extended `PaymentProvider` port: Checkout Sessions priced from `PLAN_CATALOG`, signature-verified webhooks over raw bytes → `Invoice` rows + subscription status (`ApplyPaymentEvent`, UoW-atomic), Invoices panel in Billing; `PAYMENTS_MODE=offline`/no `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` → deterministic mock (CI offline). **Customer Portal (slice 34)** — self-service plan/proration/payment-method/cancel via Stripe's hosted UI (`createPortalSession` + "Manage billing" button; mock offline URL). **Programmatic proration + refunds (slice 40, programa v8)** — `PaymentProvider.{previewProration,changePlan,refund}` over the stored `providerSubscriptionId`: plan change prorates (`create_prorations`, preview endpoint), cancel takes an opt-in prorated refund of the unused period (credit invoice). **Partial (amount-level) refunds + `always_invoice` + refund preview ✅ slice 41 (programa v9)**: `refund({amountCents})` clamped to the invoice ceiling → credit invoice; `previewRefund` (preview == executed); `changePlan({prorationBehavior})` (default `create_prorations`). Deferred: netting vs prior partial refunds, line-item-level refunds

## 3) Missing / deferred (with the blocker)

- [ ] **Orchestration DAG canvas** — 🔴 blocked on the real TOM microkernel (keystone §7)
- [x] **Chat (text)** — ✅ slice 8 on `main` behind the stub brain (real answers + live SSE push land with the Brain slice); **voice** 🔴 still blocked on Brain/Claude + STT/TTS
- [x] **Reports** — ✅ read-only over slice-3 `Run`/`RunResult`, **route wired** at `/projects/:id/reports`; per-tool "Tools" breakdown deferred (needs a tool/discipline dimension on `RunResult`)
- [ ] **Session replay (web/android)** — 🔴 needs per-action timeline data slice-3 doesn't persist yet
- [ ] **Mobile app (Expo)** — 🔴 not started
- [x] **Forgot / reset password + Email** — ✅ slice 12 on `main`: enumeration-safe 202, sha256-only 30-min single-use token, reset revokes all sessions, `EmailPort` **real SMTP adapter on `main` (slice 17)** — nodemailer via `SMTP_URL`, credential-scrubbed errors, recording stub offline/CI; Forgot/Reset screens wired
- [x] **Google / SSO login** — ✅ **slice 15 on `main`** (AC-AUTH-15 closed): Google OIDC (PKCE+state/nonce single-use, `jose` JWKS) behind the frozen `IdentityProvider`; login-or-register with unusable password; unconfigured → button degrades (`?sso=unavailable`); stub only via explicit `SSO_MODE=offline` (refused in production). SAML still disabled
- [x] **Per-org RAG grounding** — ✅ on `main`: `GenerateDrafts` grounds on the org's own chunks (scope `shared`/NULL) + the global corpus via slot-optional `retrieveScoped`; agent-scoped chunks stay private to their agent's chat
- [x] **PDF / .docx ingest** — ✅ on `main` (`parse-document`); Knowledge now ingests `.md`/`.txt`/`.pdf`/`.docx`
- [x] **Billing → new 4-tier model** — ✅ on `main` (subscription migrated to 4-tier + `/billing` re-skinned to capture 12)

## 4) Audit remediation (see [`audit-followup.md`](audit-followup.md))

- [x] **Batch A** (input limits, body limit + 413 filter, in-mem↔Prisma order parity, cookie-name centralization) — ✅ on `main`
- [x] **#1/#2** atomic knowledge upload + chunk FKs/indexes — ✅ on `main` (via look&feel merge)
- [x] **#6/#7/#10** ListFeatures N+1 · TC-key race · batch RAG ingest — ✅ on `main` (via look&feel merge)
- [x] **R2** shared `apps/web/src/lib/http.ts` — ✅ on `main` (via look&feel merge)
- [x] **Batch C (auditoría v2)** — ✅ on `main` (`e82292c`): atomic reset-token claim (UoW) · timing-safe forgot · multer>=2.2.0 override · HNSW index + deterministic ANN query · AuthHero rAF pause · SSE withCredentials
- [x] **Vitest 3 toolchain** — ✅ on `main` (programa v3): vitest 3.2.7 + vite 6.4.3, zero test adaptations, `pnpm audit` 6 vulns (1 critical) → **0**
- [x] **Real secret vault** — ✅ on `main` (programa v3, `specs/slices/20-secret-vault/`): `AzureKeyVaultSecretVault` behind the frozen port, security inversion (`VAULT_MODE=offline` explicit-only, refused in prod; missing config = boot error), injective case-insensitive-safe name mapping
- [ ] **Bloque 3 (owner decision):** rate-limit fail-open policy · ~~per-IP backoff (own slice)~~ (**done — slice 39, programa v8**) · pagination (own slice) · RAG final posture. (~~pin GitHub Actions to SHA~~ — done, slice 38. ~~optimize heavy assets (E5)~~ — **done 2026-07-09**: the oversized `public/` PNGs were resized to fit 256px + the orphaned brand exports deleted, ~3.95 MB off the build; no policy needed, so it didn't wait on the Bloque-3 decision.)
